# Teamwork

### Requirements
This lecture is closely related to the "Git and GitHub" lecture. It would be best to conduct it right in the next class.

### Description
In this lecture, we will discuss software development methodologies, comparing traditional and agile approaches. We will present the key phases of the software development process: requirements gathering, planning, implementation, testing, verification, and deployment.

Next, we will talk about the Agile Manifesto and its core values. We will present the main implementations and key figures behind them. We will focus on Scrum (Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland) and Kanban (Ōno Taiichi), but we will also mention Kent Beck, Martin Fowler, and Robert C. Martin. We will compare the phases of Scrum and Waterfall in detail. Later, we will examine the lifecycle of a task, including task sources, task management stages, and tools such as JIRA and GitHub Project.

Later, we will deal with the difference between theory and practice. We will discuss team productivity, task distribution, and avoiding problems such as burnout.

### Lecture Plan

| Topic | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Software Development Phases | Requirements Gathering, Planning, Implementation, Testing, Verification, Deployment (+ feedback), Test in production (sometimes it makes sense) |
| Waterfall Model | Better waterfall with feedback at each stage |
| Agile Manifesto | Individuals and interactions over processes and tools, Working software over comprehensive documentation, Customer collaboration over contract negotiation, Responding to change over following the plan |
| Key Theorists and Their Ideas | Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland - Scrum, Ōno Taiichi - Kanban, Kent Beck - Extreme Programming (pair programming, mob programming), Martin Fowler - code patterns, refactoring, Robert C. Martin - SOLID principles |
| Scrum Phases (compared to Waterfall) | Requirements Gathering, Sprint Planning, Sprint, Standups, Minimum Viable Product, Post Mortem, Retrospective |
| Task Lifecycle | Task Sources (user bugs, internal bugs, new user features, new manager features), To Do, In Progress, Done, Won't Fix (Shelved, Postponed, Functions as Designed), Review, Backlog, Priority vs Severity |
| Tools | JIRA, YouTrack, GitHub Project, Trello, Corkboard with sticky notes, GitHub PRs + Code Review |
| Theory vs Practice | Lack of precisely defined roles, Different teams use different methodologies (other Agile, but also non-Agile), Team leader: manager, tech expert, everything in between, Scrum master: should not be the team leader, but often is, Strange case of QA engineer - should be in the team, but is not, Bus factor vs efficiency from specialization vs context switching, Ritualization of standups, post mortems, and retrospectives, Deep backlog, zombie tasks, side tasks, blob tasks, exception tasks, Initial plan is often based on incorrect assumptions |
| Myth of the Super-Programmer | Job market situation (job offers mainly for senior developers), Team productivity estimation, Bus factor, bottleneck, Gate-keeping, impostor syndrome, burnout, Alternative: balance in task distribution considering personal preferences |
