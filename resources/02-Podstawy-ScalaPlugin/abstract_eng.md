# Basics of Programming in Scala and Using IntelliJ IDEA + Scala Plugin

### Lecture Plan

* Comparison of basic Java and Scala constructs
  * Variables and constants
  * Immutable vs mutable collections

  * Functions and methods
  * case class, case object, companion object, trait, sealed trait, enum
  * Comparison of sealed trait and enum using binary tree implementation as an example
  * Keywords: final, inline, transparent
  * Extension methods
  * apply and unapply
  * Pattern matching
* How to create a new Scala project in IntelliJ IDEA
  * Configuration
  * Running the project
* Basic features of IntelliJ IDEA and Scala Plugin
  * User interface (How to use Settings)
  * Debugger
  * Code highlighting
  * Code completion (excluding AI Assistant)
  * Unused code analysis
  * Support for build tools (mention that there will be a separate lecture on this)
  * Inlay hints + X-Ray
* How to use AI Assistant (this could potentially be a separate lecture)
  * Chat
  * Code completion

### Notes:
To demonstrate the features, a simple but non-trivial program will be needed to navigate through.
