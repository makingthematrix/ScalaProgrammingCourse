# Git and GitHub

### Description
This lecture is an introduction to the Git version control system and its practical applications. We will begin by discussing what version control systems are, their evolution from CVS and SVN to Git, and the motivations behind Git's creation by Linus Torvalds. We will also look at statistics regarding the use of different version control systems among programmers.

Next, we will cover the basic Git commands such as `init`, `clone`, `checkout`, `branch`, `commit`, and `push`, which are essential for daily use. We will also address conflict resolution in Git: we will discuss situations where conflicts occur and how to handle them using commands such as `blame`, `cherry-pick`, `merge`, `rebase`, `reflog`, and `reset`.

We will then discuss Git Flow, a branching model for Git, and the GitHub platform. I will show students how to set up a repository, choose the appropriate license, and discuss GitHub features such as Issues, Pull Requests, and GitHub Actions. Additionally, we will briefly discuss the GitLab platform and the GitHub plugin in IntelliJ IDEA.
